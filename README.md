# fedlex_app
[Fedlex](https://https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/) is Switzerland's official publication platform for all federal law. Every law student will spend countless hours on here, so why not turn this into an app? That's what I'm doing!

### Main features
- Search for publications
- Display them
- Save publications / "Favourites"
- Create collections consisting of multiple publications (for example "Criminal Law" with the most important laws related to this subject)
- (?) Add BGE / BGer (decisions of Switzerland's highest federal courts)
